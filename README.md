# Conway's Game of Life

This is an implementation of **Conway's Game of Life** using C++ and SFML. The Game of Life is a cellular automaton created by John Conway.

This is a super basic implenentation I got bored and made over the Summer, Cellular Automation is very interesting.

    C - Clear board
